# Portfolio
Liam Pearson's portfolio of past projects and assignments. Each portfolio is an analaysis of data presented in a jupyter notebook. 

## Portfolio1
This first portfolio provides an analysis of some data derived from a cycling GPS computer that records a number of variables at regular intervals during a race.  I was provided with nine files in the GPX XML format. A sample function that reads this data into a Pandas DataFrame and then the analysis is conducted. 

## Portfolio2
The second portfolio reproduces some work on predicting the energy usage of a house based on IoT measurements of temperature and humidity and weather observations. The original code was written in R and so I reproduced some analysis and plots in Python to validate the results. The target paper is: 
Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house. Luis M. Candanedo, VÃ©ronique Feldheim, Dominique Deramaix. Energy and Buildings, Volume 140, 1 April 2017, Pages 81-97, ISSN 0378-7788, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.083.

Within my analysis you'll find:
- exploration of variables
- A Linear model
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)


## Portfolio 3
This third portfolio looks at classification. Using Gaussian and Multinomial Naive Bayes, classification models were produced to see whether or not a customer will subscribe to a term deposit

Data manipultion is demonstrated in the form of:
- String variables were encoded
- continuous variables were discretized
